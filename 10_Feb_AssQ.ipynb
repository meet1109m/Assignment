    "'r' (Read mode): This is the default mode. It is used to open a file for reading. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, an FileNotFoundError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (Write mode): This mode is used to open a file for writing. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file is created. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (Append mode): This mode is used to open a file for appending data. If the file exists, the file pointer is placed at the end of the file, allowing new data to be written at the end. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (Exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to open a file exclusively for writing. It creates a new file and raises a FileExistsError if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' (Text mode): This is the default mode. It is used to open a file in text mode, which means the file is read or written as a text file (default encoding is platform-dependent).\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (Binary mode): This mode is used to open a file in binary mode, which means the file is read or written in binary format.\n",
    "\n",
    "'+' (Read and write mode): This mode allows both reading and writing to a file. For example, 'r+' opens a file for reading and writing."
